# Zero Humanity Cyberdecks

I don't know about you, but as someone that used to play a lot of tabletop Cyberpunk 2020, it irked me a little bit when I found out EVERY cyberdeck in the game has a Humanity cost. This is also refered to as your Cyberware Capacity. I was pretty sure that they only had a cost of eddies, the skill to utilize them, and a datajack. Even the less extensive, and less secure, internal Cyberdecks were simply an addition to an already existing Cyberlimb, using it's IO ports. This required the limb to be removed instead of someone simply disconnecting you should something go ary.

So, I present to you, Zero Humanity Cyberdecks! All I've done is gone through Wolvenkit and located every single Cyberdeck and their upgraded versions, and tweaked their variant TweakDBID entry with a TweakXL YAML edit, to Variants.Humanity0Cost. That's it. This automagically changes the Cost and Requirement of every Cyberdeck it's done to, to Zero in my testing.

In my rifling through files I found that some of the Cyberdecks are simply a 'counterpart' of others and I've left them that way. It seems to work just fine, and should play nice with other mods as long as they aren't specifically editing the 'variant' TweakDBID. If they have counterparts they refer to I will indicate what they are, as that is the one holding the Variants.Humanity#Cost TweakDBID that was necessary to change. All brands share a common base, utilizing counterparts. Some have less entries than others, due to starting at a higher tier. I'll also throw in what the original cost was, so you know how much Humanity you're saving for all of those other shiny chrome parts.
